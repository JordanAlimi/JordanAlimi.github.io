Hey, my name is Jordan Alimi-Tollgreve but I'm called Alimi by most. I'm 22 years old living in Montreal, Quebec. I love the internet, hip hop, and wandering. I enjoy solving architectural puzzles while shouting to the gods in frustration.

# What do you do?
I design code that doesn't break, no exception.

# Who are your favorite artists?
I'm a big hip hop head. My favorites would be Atmosphere, Biggie and Pete Rock. It hurts to disclude many other great artists.

# What programming languages do you use?
I use JavaScript, C# and Java. With some dabbling in Elm and Python.

# You love wandering?
Yes, I enjoy taking a stroll with my thoughts without worrying about my destination.
